# Go-Fish-ICS4UI
This is a simple Go Fish game that is for my school project

The following is how the game works
You will be the player and face a bot. You will go first and ask the bot for a card, if the bot has the card, you will increase your number of pairs. If the bot does not have the requested card, you will draw a card. This pattern will continue with the player and bot alternating turns until there are no more cards remaining in the deck.
